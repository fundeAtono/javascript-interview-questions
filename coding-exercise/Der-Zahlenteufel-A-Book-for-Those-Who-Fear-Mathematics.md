Der Zahlenteufel is not only a book about math, but also a book about language and logic. The Number Devil invents his own terms for mathematical concepts, such as "bonacci numbers" for Fibonacci numbers, "rutabagas" for square roots, and "vroom numbers" for powers of ten. He also challenges Robert to solve puzzles and riddles using numbers and words. For example, he asks Robert to find a word that contains all five vowels in alphabetical order (the answer is "abstemious").
 
The book also explores the philosophical and historical aspects of math, such as the paradoxes of infinity, the origins of zero, and the contributions of famous mathematicians like Pythagoras, Pascal, and Euler. The Number Devil tells Robert stories and anecdotes about these figures and their discoveries. He also shows Robert how math can be applied to real-life situations, such as cryptography, music, and art.
 
By the end of the book, Robert has overcome his fear of math and has developed a curiosity and appreciation for it. He also becomes friends with the Number Devil, who reveals his real name to be Teplotaxl. The book ends with Robert waking up from his last dream and finding a gift from the Number Devil: a calculator that can perform any calculation imaginable.

It is a book that can make you think and wonder, as well as laugh and smile. It is a book that can show you the beauty and magic of math, as well as the logic and creativity of language.
